## Progress Summary
We pulled in the initial design of the interface, the class diagram, and the use case diagram from existing CSCI 363 
models. We also created an initial Gantt chart. We haven’t begun the program development of the interface, so we haven’t 
encountered any issues there. The only issue we encountered was some uncertainty with the planning phase between report 
2 and the presentation. As such, this section is left as TBD.

By the next reporting period, we hope to have more of the application modeled with activity and state diagrams.

## Interface Drawings
